    [Verse 1]<br>
We're leaving together<br>
But still it's farewell<br>
And maybe we'll come back<br>
To earth, who can tell?<br>
I guess there is no one to blame<br>
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)<br>
Will things ever be the same again?<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
It's the final countdown<br>
The final countdown<br>
Ohh! <br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
We're heading for Venus (Venus)<br>
And still we stand tall<br>
Cause maybe they've seen us<br>
And welcome us all yeah<br>
With so many lightyears to go<br>
And things to be found (to be found)<br>
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
It's the final countdown<br>
The final countdown<br>
The final countdown <br>
(Final countdown). Ohhh oh oh ohhhh<br>
The final countdown. <br>
Ohhhhhhhhhh<br>
It's the final countdown<br>
The final countdown<br>
The final countdown <br>
(Final countdown)<br>
Ohhh. It's the final countdown<br>
We're leaving togetherrrr. <br>
(The final countdown)<br>
We'll all miss her so<br>
It's the final countdown (Final countdown)<br>
Ohhh. It's. the. final. countdown<br>

We've known each other for so long<br>
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br>
Inside, we both know what's been going on<br>
We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
<br>
And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
<br>
Never gonna give you up<br>
Never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry<br>
Never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
